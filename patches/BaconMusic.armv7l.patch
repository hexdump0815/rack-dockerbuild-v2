there is some ugly build hack required to make it compile and work properly on
armv7l - so far i did not manage to get this properly into the make/cmake setup
and some magic steps have to be done by hand still as a result: i simply
started the build via "RACK_DIR=/compile/Rack make dist" and as soon as it
started compiling i added "-latomic" to the end of
dep/cmake-build/CMakeFiles/plugin.dir/link.txt - not a proper solution, but at
least a way to get it built for now :)
